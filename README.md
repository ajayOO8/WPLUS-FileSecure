### Features

**File Encryptor:** WPLUS Securely encrypt your private files and documents.

**Algorithm:** WPLUS currently uses strong encryption algorithm AES(128 bits). Future updates will include AES(256 bits),RC6(256 bits) Blowfish(448 bits) and many more strong file encryption algorithms.

**Password:** Every Encrypted file can only be opened by a secured 128 bits password. Future updates will include 32 bits,64 bits, and no password features.

**Encrypt and share:** WPLUS gives liberty to user to encrypt file in one go and share file instantly on Email services like Gmail, YahooMail, Hotmail and on Instant Messengers like WhatsApp and Hike.

**Steganography:** Future update will include steganographic feature(i.e. concealing a text within an image).A symmetric cipher algorithm is combined with a steganographic algorithm(F5 algorithm) to build a final steganogram(JPG image).

**Bubble:** One of the major update would be to make WPLUS more user friendly. Bubble feature will make sure that user doesn't have to open the app everytime she want to encrypt and share a file.
